Although this project is not even a capable prototype, and far from complete,
this project is likely to be abandoned as I have to spend more time on other important projects.  
That being said, this is definitely a fun attempt at prospective projections and the rendering pipeline,
and I have definitely learnt a lot during the scratching process.  
Maybe, I'd hope, one day I might come back to this (though unlikely :C).
